This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to update the words

Place a text file named "Text.txt" inside the src folder with the text you want to be parced. Then run the following in the /src folder:

### `node parseTextFile.js`

This will parse the text file and create the words.js file which you can use when compiling the game.<br />

(Or you can use `npm run parse` or `yarn parse`)
